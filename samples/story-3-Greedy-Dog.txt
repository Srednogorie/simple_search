Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a dog named Max. Max was a big, fluffy dog with bright, curious eyes. He loved to roam around the village, sniffing everything and everyone. But Max had one big problem—he was very greedy. 

One sunny morning, Max woke up with a rumbling tummy. He became curious about the smells coming from the bakery in the village square. The scent of fresh bread and sweet pastries filled the air, making his mouth water. Max thought, "If I could just have a taste, I would be so happy. "

Eager to grab a snack, Max dashed to the bakery. The baker, Mr. Brown, was busy making a huge cake for a special celebration. Max watched, his eyes wide with excitement. Just then, Mr. Brown left the room to fetch some eggs. This was Max's chance! 

Max tiptoed inside the bakery and saw the cake sitting on the table, looking fluffy and delicious. He thought to himself, "Just a little bite won't hurt! " So, he jumped up and took a big bite out of the cake. It was so sweet that he couldn't stop himself. Max devoured more and more until the whole cake was almost gone. 

Suddenly, he heard footsteps! Mr. Brown was back. Max quickly licked his lips and tried to hide behind a big bag of flour. But it was too late. The baker saw what had happened. Mr. Brown gasped and exclaimed, "Max, you greedy dog! You have ruined my cake! "

Max felt ashamed. He did not mean to cause trouble. As Mr. Brown waved his hands, Max had an idea. He remembered how much the village loved his tricks at the yearly fair. Maybe he could help fix this mess. 

Max ran out to the gardens where the villagers were preparing for the celebration. He found his friend Lucy, a little girl who adored him. He barked and danced around her, trying to get her attention. Lucy giggled and decided to follow Max back to the bakery. 

When they arrived, Mr. Brown was still upset. But Max wagged his tail and nudged the baker gently. Lucy chimed in, "Mr. Brown, can we help? We can bake another cake together! " The baker thought for a moment and then smiled. With Lucy and Max’s help, they started baking. 

Once the new cake was ready, it was even bigger and better than before. The village celebrated happily, and Max learned that sharing and being kind was more rewarding than being greedy. From that day on, he became the village's most beloved, not just for his fluffy coat but also for his generous heart. Teleportation.
