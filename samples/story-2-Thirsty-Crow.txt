Once upon a time, in a sunny village, lived a clever crow. One hot summer day, the sun shone brightly, and the ground was dry. The crow flew high in the sky, feeling very thirsty. He looked down for water but saw none. After flying for a while, he finally spotted a clay pot sitting in a garden. 

The crow quickly swooped down and landed beside the pot. His eyes sparkled with hope as he peered inside. But when he looked into the pot, his heart sank. There was only a little water at the bottom, far too low for him to drink. "What a terrible problem," he thought. "I am so thirsty, but I can't reach that water! "

The crow felt a little sad, but then he remembered how clever he was. He thought hard and looked around for a solution. Suddenly, his eyes fell on some pebbles scattered on the ground. An idea popped into his mind! "I can use these pebbles to raise the water level," he said excitedly. 

Without wasting a moment, the crow picked up a small pebble in his beak. He flew back to the pot and dropped it inside. Plop! The pebble sank to the bottom, and a little water rose up. The crow was sure this would work. So, he quickly grabbed another pebble and flew down again. Plop! Another pebble joined the first one. The water level continued to rise, but it still was not enough. 

The crow felt a bit tired, but he didnâ€™t give up. He continued to pick up pebble after pebble. One by one, he dropped them into the pot. Each time a pebble went in, he saw the water getting closer and closer to the top. At last, after many trips, the water was so high that the crow could reach it! 

With joy in his heart, the clever crow leaned down and took a long drink. His thirst was finally quenched. He felt proud of himself for finding a way to solve his problem. After drinking, he flew high into the sky, feeling happy and refreshed. 

From that day on, the thirsty crow became a lesson for everyone. It showed that with intelligence and determination, one can overcome obstacles. The crow had turned a disturbing challenge into a proud victory. And so, he flew on, sharing his story of cleverness and perseverance with all who would listen.
